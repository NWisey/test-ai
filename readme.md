Hello
This site was created with the help of open.ai technology.
Using AI I generated a simple webpage, and by asking it prompt, I created a theme.
This site is for showcasing some of my favourite internet music, the images and music are by an artist called Macroblank.
I designed to site to be experimental/ retro in apperance, this played well into my knowledge of css as it made it easier to style.
For the aesthetic I added a marquee footer.
It is responsive to other screen sizes.

Production process.
-ask chatgbt to generate a basic site.
-With the generated code, I changed it so it worked and then styled it to look how I wanted.
-I used some of the frameworks on W3C school to help speed my process up. I didn't use other ones because the wheren't able to give the look I wanted.
-For some elements I referenced similar code to my other projects as it helped in knowing what the code should look like/ what was valid.
-When I was stuck I asked how to fix the problem and it usually gave a valid solution.
-When I needed to add a new element I first asked chatgbt what it should look like first. I then copy the code over.

My biggest takeaway from the assignment is that the AI tools aren't yet able to write code unsupervised. However I see the potential for it to be an amazing learning tool for those who have less experience like me. I often found that asking it questions about what parts of my code do what gave me better inside into how html and css actuall function. It was more effective asking it questions on how code works, then writing it myself,  than just asking it to write the code you need.

I found the most effective prompt was giving it all my code and asking it to change it so it was responsive. The generated code was not responsive, but I was able to change some values on it to make it work properly.

Enjoy listening to some chill tunes !
